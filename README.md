# Freshman Seminar: Computer Vision Assignments

This repository contains assignments for the Freshman Seminar, focusing on deep dive code analysis, PyTorch implementation, and reproducing results from key computer vision papers.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of these assignments is not just to run the code, but to achieve a "code-level" understanding of various models. This includes:
* **Data Flow Analysis:** Tracking tensor dimensions (e.g., `[B, T, C, H, W]`).
* **Architecture Review:** In-depth analysis of components like ResBlock, Generators, and Loss Functions.
* **Environment:** Developed using **PyTorch** and executed via **Google Colab**.
* **Verification:** Measuring metrics and reproducing qualitative figures reported in original papers.
